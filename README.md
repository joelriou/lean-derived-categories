# Formalization of derived categories in Lean/mathlib

This project contains a Lean file [LeanDerivedCategories.lean](https://github.com/joelriou/lean-derived-categories/blob/main/LeanDerivedCategories.lean)
which accompanies the paper by JoÃ«l Riou. This file follows the same structure as the paper and is meant to facilitate the cross-references between the mathematical text and the corresponding definitions in the Lean code, which is part of the mathlib branch [jriou_localization](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/4197).
